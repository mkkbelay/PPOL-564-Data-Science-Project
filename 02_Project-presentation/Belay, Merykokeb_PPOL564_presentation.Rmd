## Background {data-background="#F5F5F5"}

- As of December 1, 2020, there are <span style="color: red">**_13,714,024_**</span> confirmed COVID-19 cases and <span style="color: red">**_270,532_** </span> deaths in the United States
- Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions remain at increased risk 
- Other people who need extra precautions: racial and ethnic minority groups; people living in rural communities; people experiencing homelessness e.t.c..
- Data showing that some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by COVID-19

</div>

## Health Disparities {data-background=#F5F5F5}
- Differences in health outcomes between population groups closely linked to social,economic, and environmental disadvantage (*Healthy People 2020*)
- <span style="color: red">**Social determinants of health**</span> 
  - Access to educational, economic, job opportunities,
  - Health care access and quality
  - Housing and community design

## Methods/Approaches Considered {data-background=#F5F5F5}
- State-level COVID-19 cases and deaths (*The COVID Tracking Project*) and state-level data on legislative efforts to preserve or strengthen provisions of the Affordable Care Act (*HealthInsurance.org*)
- Outcome: 1=disparity; 0=no disparity
  - proportion of cases/deaths at least 33% higher than the Census Percentage of Population
  - proportion of cases/deaths elevated whether we include or exclude cases/deaths with unknown race/ethnicity.
  - proportion of cases/deaths based on at least 30 actual cases or deaths
- Features: 36 different measures 
- Modeling: Naive Bayes, K nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest

  
## Methods/Approaches Used {data-background=#F5F5F5}
- NYT; ACS; County Ranking and Roadmaps; Bureau of Economic Analysis
- Outcome: constructed using NYT and ACS data

##  {data-background="#F5F5F5}
- Features: range from 27 to 42 and cover a range of county characteristics
  - Percentage of households that spend 50% or more of their household income on housing, 
  - Percentage of population who are low-income and do not live close to a grocery store, 
  - Percentage of population under age 65 without health insurance, 
- Modeling techniques
  - Linear Model
  - K-nearest neighbors
  - Bagging
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest

## Results  {data-background=#F5F5F5}
**Attempt 1** (27 features; 702 observations)

## Plans to mitigate challenges

- Keep trying different version of outcome variable 
- Try imputing missing values 
- Consider correlation between variables
- Better features from the Social Vulnerability Index
